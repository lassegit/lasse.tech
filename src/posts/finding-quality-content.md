Finding quality content can be a hassle if you aren't a compulsive news reader. One way is to utilize Reddit's domain listing search. With this you get a subreddit view of what have been shared from that domain, e.g. [github.com](https://old.reddit.com/domain/github.com/). Additionally, it allows you to sort best shared daily, weekly and monthly posts. Here are some of the domains I check:
