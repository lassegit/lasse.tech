Github actually offers ways to find other Github users. You can find users by: 

- **username** (just search for the name), 
- **fullname** (fullname:"Lasse T."), 
- **location** (location:"Berlin"), 
- **number of followers** (followers:"10"))
- **number of repositiories** (repos:"10")
- **language contributions** (language:"Javascript")

To search for javascript contributers in Berlin with more than 10 followers type the following the search field:

[location:"Berlin" language:"Javascript" followers:">10"](https://github.com/search?q=location%3A%22Berlin%22+language%3A%22Javascript%22+followers%3A%22%3E10%22&type=Users)
