Next to me sad an experienced and devout vegan, albeit a nice guy. He was mixing a liters of lemon juice for him to consume during the day, great resource of C-Vitamins he said. Afterwards he pulled his medicine cabinet out where he kept his large amount of dietary supplements. An passerby noted it looked like his grand-moms pill collection, which I though was rather amusing observation and spot on. It seemed strange, well practical sick, that a young man would need to eat that amount of pills without going through serious medical treatment.</p>\n<p>I forgot about it until I chatting with a young Ukrainian girl I meet at a party. She had just moved to Berlin and worked as an au-pair. She proudly have become vegan, as she stated at the very beginning of our conversation. A statement which experienced have told me means that one have accept this dogma to continue the conversation in good spirits. I obliged quietly. The next few days it kept coming back to me, I felt that I have been preached to and that I need to decide upon the merits of it. </p>\n<p>Giving that I am learning German at the moment I try to read as much as possible in German, so I looked up the German Wikipedia for "Veganismus". The take on veganism in the Anglosphere and the Germanosphere (perhaps in all of continental Europe?) are the direct opposite. The American Dietetic Association (ADA) remarkable recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood and for athletes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ADA even recommends veganism for stages of life where nutritional needs are of special importance. This stands in stark contrast to the Germanosphere where the Deutschen Gesellschaft für Ernährung (DGE) states that it is very difficult or impossible to get sufficient supply of certain nutrients. And furthermore the DGE expressly does not recommend vegan nutrition for pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, children and young people.</p>\n<p>The German Wikipedia gives a detailed and concise breakdown on a per nutrient basis of the potential nutritional dangers of vegan diets. Which made the ADA\'s recommendation even more incomprehensible. I wrote the ADA to remedy this illogical confusion and received this complicated scientific document which one must presume they consider accessible public information in year 2018. The document doesn\'t deliver sufficient evidence, especially regarding ensuring the nutritional needs of nutritional demanding stages of life. It gives best and highly complicated practices for vegan supplements on a variety of nutrients, such as n-3 Fatty Acids it states; </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"The clinical relevance of reduced eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status among vegetarians and vegans is unknown. Long-chain n-3 fatty acids are important for the development and maintenance of the brain, retina, and cell membranes and favorably impact pregnancy outcomes and risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic diseases."</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The other oblivious point it is so complex. Does anyone without a doctoral degree know that the daily required dose of n-3 fatty acids are: "The Dietary Reference Intake for ALA are 1.6 g/day and 1.1 g/day, for men and women, respectively" and that these can be supplemented by: "Low-dose micro-algae based DHA supplements are available for all vegetarians with increased needs." And do vegan get their nutrient uptake measured to ensure that they get all the adequate nutrients throughout their life stages. Or as recommended by ADA:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Provided that adequate nutrition education is given, a therapeutic vegetarian diet performs as well as omnivorous diets in terms of adherence. As with implementation of any diet, employing a variety of counseling strategies, including motivational interviewing, frequent sessions, cooking demonstrations, and incentives, can improve nutrition-related outcomes when using a vegetarian diet therapeutically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The prime justification for recommending vegan diets seems to rely on its positive effects on primarily health and cancer – which may be true. Evidence suggest that vegan diets is associated with weight-loss and maintain healthy weight. One could speculate that vegan diets are simply recommended because of it supposedly weight-loss effects (as well as other lifestyle diseases). In this sense the recommendation is more tactical than actual scientific, perhaps really an act of desperation giving that 39.6% of the US population are obese. </p>\n<p>ADA\'s recommendation is a testament to the seriousness of the dietary and health crisis we are in. Weight-loss is the deciding factor at the expense of nutrition.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"26 June, 2018",path:"/on-veganism/",title:"On veganism",tags:["veganism","health"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
